# Security Policy for FreeMD2PDF

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The FreeMD2PDF team takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please email [hichem.tab2002@gmail.com](mailto:hichem.tab2002@gmail.com) with the subject "FreeMD2PDF Security Vulnerability". Please include:

## Client-Side Security

FreeMD2PDF is a client-side application that processes all data locally in your browser. Your documents never leave your device during the conversion process, which minimizes many traditional security concerns.

However, we still recommend:

- Always use the application from our official website or GitHub repository
- Keep your browser updated to the latest version
- Be cautious of any third-party extensions that might interact with the application

- Don't process sensitive or confidential information on public or shared computers
- Clear your browser cache after processing sensitive documents
- Verify the URL to ensure you're using the official FreeMD2PDF application
